# 2021-PRP-Program
The repository seems messy, it's acually because this program went through several big changes, and my works changes as well.

The eventual job is to test, **whether compression of video will deal great loss to AI detection result**.

Because it's costly to transmit huge data flow between server and edge devices.

But from begining to the end, I learnt about network communication, OpenCV, some basic ML frames, and some interesting AI models. I'm glad with these achievements.
